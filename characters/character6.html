        <div class="character-info">
            <p><center>Hwang Dongsuk (황동석) was a lizard and the older brother of Hwang Dongsoo. When he attempted to murder both Jinwoo and Jinho to make some fast cash, Jinwoo slaughtered his teammates and beheaded him with his daggers, killing him too.</center></p>

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Hwang was a stocky and muscular young man with spiky black hair, neatly trimmed facial hair, and several scars on his left arm. He wore a simple black shirt, black gloves, brown pants, and blue armor on both his right shoulder and lower legs.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Much like his brother, Hwang was selfish, arrogant, and sociopathic with little regard for the innocent lives that he took for his own benefit. He was also quick to give up when faced with a stronger opponent in battle, as displayed by how he begged for his life after Jinwoo smashed him into the ground, and was implied to have a strained relationship with his brother, as he did not allow his teammates to even mention him.
                <br><br>
            However, despite all his character flaws, Hwang had a sense of loyalty towards his homeland and resented his brother's decision of betraying his own people for money.
