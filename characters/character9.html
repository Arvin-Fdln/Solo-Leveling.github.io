            <p><center>Liu Zhigang (류즈캉刘志刚) is the strongest hunter in China and one of the five National Level Hunters, ranking 2nd in the world.[1]</center></p>

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>In the original timeline, Zhigang was a muscular and handsome young man with dark yellow eyes and long black hair that he wore in a ponytail, with several large additional strands of hair dangling from his head like leaves from a tree. When agitated or using his powers, his eyes glowed bright yellow. He was also usually seen wearing red or yellow cloaks with thick black collars, black pants, and black boots.
                <br><br>
            In the revised timeline, Zhigang's hair turned white, presumably due to the fact that he did not become a hunter again until several decades after the timeline was originally reset with the Cup of Reincarnation.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>In the original timeline, Zhigang was brash and battle-hungry, as displayed by how he expressed disappointment at not being able to fight the Ant King. He was also very blunt in conversation, as displayed when he said to a Chinese reporter that Sung Jinwoo was worlds above him in strength and dismissed those who believed otherwise as fools. However, he did act friendly and humble towards those who had gained his respect.
                <br><br>
            In the revised timeline, Zhigang retained most of his original character traits and his overall personality did not change much, aside from having a strong interest in martial arts. He also had a great amount of determination and willpower, as shown by how he refused the offers made to him by the Itarim even though he could have gained immense power in exchange, and successfully resisted their attempts to possess his body for two years.[2]
