            <p><center>Kim Sangshik (김상식) was a Korean D-Rank Hunter and one of the six survivors of the first Double Dungeon incident.</center></p>

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Kim was a middle-aged man with gray hair in a crew cut. He wore a blue blazer over a white collared shirt and jeans..</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Kim typically acted in a friendly manner and enjoyed drinking coffee in the mornings. However, he was also selfish and cared more about his own life than the lives of others, as displayed when he left Jinwoo behind to die inside the Double Dungeon for the sake of his family.
                <br><br>
            Despite his actions, Kim was not without remorse. After surviving the Double Dungeon, he felt horrible for how he treated Jinwoo and intended to make amends. Shortly before he died, Kim made good on his word and finally apologized to Jinwoo for everything, showing that at the end of the day, he was still a morally decent person at heart.
