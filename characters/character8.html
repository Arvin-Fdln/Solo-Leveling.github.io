            <p><center>Cha Hae-In (차해인) is a Korean S-Rank Hunter and the Vice-Guild Master of the Hunters Guild. She is also the wife of Sung Jinwoo and the mother of their son Sung Suho.</center></p>

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Hae-In is an attractive young woman with gray eyes and blonde hair in a bob cut. She is short in stature with a slender build and large chest. She typically wears red-themed armor on raids and carries a black sword with a silver hilt. When using her abilities, her eyes glow yellow.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Hae-In comes off as rather serious and calm, caring about the lives of others, which combined with her meticulous nature causes her to develop a habit of patrolling around the boss's lair to ensure that their guild workers doesn't get harmed, such as the mining and hauling teams who are composed of people unable to defend themselves.
                <br><br>
            She is rather diligent in her sword training, taking lessons from Song Chi-Yul, even after becoming an S-Rank. Unlike most higher-ranked Hunters, she has no biased against lower-ranked Hunters, admiring Chi-Yul, who is a C-Ranked Hunter who honed his skills in his lifetime, believing that she couldn't defeat him if it was simply swordplay. She was also perceptive enough to realize after her first meeting with Sung Jinwoo that something wasn't quite right with him.
                <br><br>
            However, from time to time, similar to Jinwoo, Hae-In has been noted to be rather socially awkward when it comes to things outside of dungeon raiding. She is noted to not have many friends, often becoming flustered depending on the situation, such as how she easily got embarrassed and almost instantly lost her composure after Jinwoo teased her over her pickaxe incident.
                <br><br>
            Cha Hae-In soon developed interest in Jinwoo since he's the sole Hunter who doesn't smell foul to her, which soon developed into feeling after being saved by him during Fourth Jeju Island Raid..
