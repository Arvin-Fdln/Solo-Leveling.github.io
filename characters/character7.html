            <p><center>Thomas Andre (트마스 아드레) is the strongest hunter in America and one of the five National Level Hunters, ranking 1st in the world.[1]</center></p>

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Thomas is an extremely large and muscular man with long blond hair, red eyes, a toothy smile, an overgrown blonde goatee, and black tattoos. When using his powers or agitated, his eyes glow bright yellow and golden vein-like patterns appear across his body. He is almost always dressed in a Hawaiian shirt, sunglasses, beach shorts, and sandals.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Thomas is a proud and aggressive individual with a strong sense of camaraderie. As a result, he still gave Hwang Dongsoo a proper funeral even though the man was a heartless murderer and even fought Jinwoo to the death in order to save his life. Thomas also has little tolerance for insubordination and disrespect, as displayed when he threatened Dongsoo for attempting to argue with him and became angry when Jinwoo refused to spare Dongsoo for torturing Jinho.
                <br><br>
            However, despite his pride, Thomas is very gracious in defeat, as he showed no ill will towards Jinwoo after the latter nearly killed him during their battle in the States. He also hates owing people favors and will go out of his way to make sure that they're even, as displayed when he traveled to Korea just to treat Jinwoo to a meal and give him Kamish's Wrath as repayment for sparing the lives of his guildmates.
