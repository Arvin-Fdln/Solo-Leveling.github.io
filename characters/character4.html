            <p><center>Yoo Jinho (유진호) is a Korean D-Rank Hunter. He is also a famous video game developer and the CEO of Ahjin Soft.</center></p>

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Jinho is a young man with gray eyes, a boyish face, and custard-colored hair that is shaved on all sides of his head. Much like Jinwoo, he is usually displayed wearing casual clothing, even on raids.
                <br><br>
            In the revised timeline, he is shown to have grown older with a more masculine face, a leaner build, and a small amount of facial hair. However, his hairstyle is still the same as it was during his youth and despite being in his forties, he actually has not aged that much and still appears to be more on the young side, with only several small wrinkles on the sides of his face and his mouth.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Jinho comes off as a lovable dork and serves as the comic relief of the series, mainly due to his tendency to take things the wrong way. Despite his comically naive nature, he is very loyal and driven, as he aspired at one point to lead the Yoojin Guild as its Guild Master and eventually take his father's place in the family business.[1] These traits are also prominent in his relationship with Jinwoo, as he sees the latter as an older brother figure and was even willing to leave his father's side to help him form his own guild.
                <br><br>
            There are two running gags with Jinho that are seen throughout the series. The first is his odd habit of dressing up in very fancy, and expensive, but also useless armor. The second is his inability to hold his liquor, as displayed when he got absolutely wasted while going out for drinks with Jinwoo and then with his cousin Soohyun.[2]
