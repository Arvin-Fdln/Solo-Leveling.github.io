        <div class="character-info">
            <p><center>Woo Jinchul (우진철) is a Korean A-Rank Hunter and the current Chairman of the Korean Hunters Association. Before ascending to this role, he was the Chief Inspector of the Hunters Association's Surveillance Team, under the leadership of the previous Chairman, Go Gunhee.</center></p>

            <h2>Appearance</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Jinchul is a handsome young man with slick orange hair, having only a single strand poking out and black eyes. When using his abilities or agitated, his eyes glow purple.
                <br><br>
            As a high-ranking official in the Korean Hunters Association, he is typically seen wearing a black suit with his sunglasses. On raids, he wears a shiny suit of silver armor with blue trims and golden shoulder plates.</p>

            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>Jinchul is a very stoic man who rarely ever shows emotion. As noted by Choi Jong-In, he does not like to speculate about things and prefers to stick only to the facts. Much like his superior Go Gunhee, Jinchul also despises those who are only after personal gain.
                <br><br>
            Despite his cold and professional exterior, Jinchul deeply respected Gunhee and was depressed for days after learning about his murder. He also has no qualms with showing his temper if he is pushed too far, as displayed when he grew annoyed with Lee Minsung's incessant demands.
