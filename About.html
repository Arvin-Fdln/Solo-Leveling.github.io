                In a world where hunters, human warriors who possess magical abilities, must battle deadly monsters 
                to protect mankind from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named Sung Jinwoo finds himself 
                in a seemingly endless struggle for survival. One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly 
                powerful dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the System 
                chooses him as its sole player and, in turn, gives him the extremely rare ability to level up 
                in strength, possibly beyond any known limits. Follow Jinwoo's journey as he fights against all 
                kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true 
                source of his powers.
